- Manual Lambda registration required in Connect console
- SSML needed for natural voice output

**Vanity Number Algorithm Considerations:**
- Dictionary-based vs random letter generation
- Success rate optimization strategies
- Performance vs quality trade-offs

## Day 3: September 20, 2025 - Major Development Sprint

### Focus
- Core Lambda implementation
- AWS infrastructure deployment
- Amazon Connect integration
- Algorithm optimization and testing

### Core Lambda Implementation

**Phone Number Processing**
- Built `cleanPhoneNumber()` function for E.164 format support
- Handles various input formats and country code stripping
- Comprehensive input validation

**Vanity Generation Algorithm**
- Implemented phone keypad mapping (2=ABC, 3=DEF, etc.)
- Created English word dictionary with 13,248 curated words
- Built scoring system for ranking vanity number quality
- Added fallback strategy for edge cases

**Critical Algorithm Challenge Solved:**
- **Problem**: Initial business dictionary had very low success rate
- **Root Cause**: Random phone digits rarely match exact word sequences
- **Solution**: Expanded to full English dictionary with smart filtering
- **Result**: Achieved high match success rate with meaningful fallbacks

**Production Features**
- AWS Lambda Powertools integration for structured logging
- PII masking for phone numbers in logs
- Error handling and input validation
- TypeScript safety throughout

### AWS Infrastructure Deployment

**CDK Implementation**
- Lambda function with ARM64 architecture for performance
- DynamoDB table with 30-day TTL for automatic cleanup
- IAM roles with appropriate permissions
- CloudWatch logging configuration

**CI/CD Pipeline**
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
- OIDC integration for secure AWS authentication
- Automated CDK deployment on main branch

**Infrastructure Challenges Resolved:**
- AWS SDK bundling conflicts resolved
- CDK deprecation warnings fixed
- Bootstrap documentation enhanced

### Amazon Connect Integration

**Major Discovery: Response Format Requirements**
- **Problem**: Connect silently failed with array responses
- **Root Cause**: Connect requires STRING_MAP format (all string values)
- **Solution**: Restructured response to individual string fields
```javascript
// Working format
{
  success: "true",
  top3_0: "555-CALL-NOW",
  top3_1: "555-SALE-NOW",
  top3_2: "555-GO-PLUMB",
  cached: "false"
}
```

**Voice Quality Improvements**
- Implemented SSML for natural phone number pronunciation
- Added proper breaks and telephone formatting
- Enhanced user experience with clear speech

**Connect Flow Design**
- Manual flow creation (CDK automation proved unreliable)
- Lambda invocation with proper error handling
- Success validation and response processing
- Professional voice experience

### Critical Bug Fixes

**Jest Test Hanging Issue**
- **Problem**: Infinite loop in random letter generation
- **Cause**: Phone numbers with 0/1 digits caused infinite loops
- **Solution**: Added maxAttempts counter and proper fallback handling
- **Result**: Test suite runs reliably (27 tests in ~6 seconds)

**CloudFormation Rollback Prevention**
- Fixed Connect flow JSON formatting issues
- Enhanced deployment validation
- Prevented infrastructure rollback loops

### End-to-End Testing
- Lambda function tested independently
- DynamoDB integration verified
- Connect flow tested with live phone calls
- Confirmed 5-store/3-return requirement met

## Day 4: September 21, 2025 - Documentation & Polish

### Focus
- Comprehensive documentation review
- Architecture decision documentation
- Deployment guide creation
- Final system validation

### Documentation Enhancements
- Created detailed architecture decisions document
- Enhanced deployment guide with step-by-step instructions
- Updated development journal with implementation details
- Comprehensive README with project overview

### Final System Validation
- Live toll-free number operational: 1-833-866-4320
- End-to-end functionality verified
- DynamoDB storage confirmed (exactly 5 per caller)
- Connect voice response tested (speaks top 3)

### Project Status

**AI Role:**
- Assisted with filter rule iteration and optimization
- Human oversight maintained for all decisions
- Final criteria locked with comprehensive testing

**Production Path:**
- Current: Bundled JSON for demo simplicity
- Future: DynamoDB storage with digit-key queries for scalability

## Technical Implementation Details

### Module Structure
The Lambda implementation consists of 10 focused TypeScript modules:
- `handler.ts` - Main entry point
- `types.ts` - Centralized type definitions
- `clean-phone.ts` - Phone number processing
- `find-words.ts` - Dictionary matching
- `generate-vanity.ts` - Core algorithm
- `format-vanity.ts` - Output formatting
- `mask-phone.ts` - PII protection
- `random-letters.ts` - Fallback generation
- `get-data.ts` - DynamoDB reads
- `save-data.ts` - DynamoDB writes

### Test Coverage
- 27 comprehensive tests covering all modules
- Edge case validation for phone number formats
- Algorithm testing with various input scenarios
- Error handling verification

### Critical Bug Resolution
**Infinite Loop Prevention:**
```typescript
const maxAttempts = count * 10; // Prevent infinite loops
while (combinations.size < count && attempts < maxAttempts) {
    attempts++;
    // ... generation logic with proper fallbacks
}
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Integration Testing Critical**: Lambda worked standalone but failed with Connect due to response format
2. **Read Documentation Carefully**: Connect's STRING_MAP requirement wasn't obvious
3. **Manual Steps Sometimes Better**: Connect flow automation via CDK proved unreliable
4. **Voice UX Matters**: Raw phone numbers sound terrible without SSML formatting
5. **Algorithm Iteration**: Initial approach needed refinement for production success rates

## Final Architecture

**Automated (CDK):**
- Lambda function deployment
- DynamoDB table creation
- IAM permissions and roles
- CloudWatch logging setup

**Manual (Required):**
- Amazon Connect instance creation
- Lambda function registration in Connect
- Contact flow design and configuration
