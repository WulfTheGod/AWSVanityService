# Development Journal

## Day 1: September 18, 2025
### Focus
- Set up repo and CDK project structure
- Planned Lambda + DynamoDB + Connect integration

### Key Decisions
- Use AWS CDK with TypeScript for IaC
- Adopt modular folder structure (`lambda/`, `utils/`, `types/`) for clarity
- Chose dictionary-based scoring for vanity number generation

### Challenges
- Defining "best" vanity number â†’ solution: multi-factor scoring (word quality, length, memorability)

### Implementation Progress
**Phone Number Cleaning (Completed)**
- Built `cleanPhoneNumber()` function to handle various input formats
- Supports Amazon Connect E.164 format (+15551234567)
- Removes non-digits and strips country code automatically
- Created comprehensive test suite with 8 test cases
- All tests passing - ready for vanity generation

### Technical Notes
- Used regex `/[^0-9]/g` to strip non-digits efficiently
- Handles 11-digit numbers by removing leading '1' country code
- Test-driven approach ensured edge cases are covered

### Next Steps
- Implement phone keypad mapping (2=ABC, 3=DEF, etc.)
- Create vanity number generation algorithm
- Build scoring system for ranking results
